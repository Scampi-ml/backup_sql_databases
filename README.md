### Features

Script dumps all MySQL (or MariaDB) databases to separate SQL files (compressed to .sql.gz) named with timestamp.
It also removes old backups (older than specified amount of days).

**NOTE:** It does split the data and the structure into separate files. Feel free to edit this.


Script updated for MariaDB 10 on Synology DSM 7.2.2-72806 Update 2 


- Added separation between data and structure
- Added each DB into its own folder
- Changed YmdHMS for filenames
- Added error reporting" or feedback on errors
- Added a bit of AI magic
- Added BACKUP_DIR_STRUCTURE path
- Added BACKUP_DIR_DATA path
- Added DATE for folders

**NOTE:** use lowercase names in the path

**NOTE:** Do not change the path for MySQL: this is set for Synology MariaDB 10 - 10.11.6-1369
